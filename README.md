# beamer_strath
This is an unofficial beamer template which may be of use for presentations by University of Strathclyde Staff and Students. Currently it only supports the science colour scheme, but can potentially be extended by adding additional color templates.

This theme is based heavily off the AnnArbour theme that ships with beamer, and I have drawn heavy help from the discussion of beamer themes at http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/146529/design-a-custom-beamer-theme-from-scratch. 

My thanks to Sam Yoffe for help with sorting out the logo.
